# Employee Insights and Attrition Analysis with Power BI  

## Overview  
This project involves analyzing employee data from Atlas Labs to derive insights into hiring trends, workforce demographics, performance metrics, and attrition patterns. Using Power BI, interactive dashboards were created to enable data-driven decisions for optimizing workforce strategies and improving retention.

## Datasets Used  
The project utilized the following datasets:  
1. **Employee**: Employee details such as ID, job role, department, etc.  
2. **RatingLevel**: Performance ratings of employees.  
3. **SatisfiedLevel**: Job satisfaction levels.  
4. **PerformanceRating**: Detailed performance metrics.  
5. **EducationLevel**: Education details of employees.  

## Key Insights  
- **Hiring Trends**: Analyzed recruitment patterns across departments and job roles over time.  
- **Demographics**: Explored age, gender, marital status, and ethnicity distributions.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated employee performance ratings and trends.  
- **Attrition Analysis**: Identified factors driving employee attrition and calculated attrition ratios.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating calculated measures and advanced metrics.  
- **Data Cleaning and Integration**: Merging and preprocessing datasets for analysis.
